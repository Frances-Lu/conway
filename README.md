# Conway's Game of Life on a Torus
Welcome to our page where we implement Conway's Game of Life onto a torus. Our main goal was to visualize this game in a new perspective where instead of a infinite 2-D graph, we change it to a 3D shape. The purpose of this was to make the game interactive so that one can visualize how Conway's Game of Life would look like when there is no clear ending. By using matrixes and graph nodes, it allowed us to build our new data structure of a torus.
